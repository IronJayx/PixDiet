1. Grilled chicken breast: Excellent choice! It's a lean protein source that's low in sodium and phosphorus.

2. Steamed vegetables: I see broccoli, carrots, and green beans. These are great low-potassium options. Broccoli is especially good as it's also low in phosphorus.

3. Brown rice: While brown rice is nutritious, it's higher in phosphorus and potassium than white rice. For your condition, it's better to have white rice in moderation. Consider switching to bulgur wheat or couscous as alternatives.

4. Lemon wedge: Great idea! Using lemon for flavor instead of salt is a smart move for reducing sodium intake.

5. Glass of water: Good to see you staying hydrated, but remember to track your fluid intake as per your doctor's recommendations.

Overall, this is a much-improved meal compared to yesterday's lunch. Here are some tips for next time:
- Replace the brown rice with a lower phosphorus grain or reduce the portion size.
- Add some low-potassium fruits like strawberries or blueberries for dessert.
- Consider adding herbs like basil or oregano to your vegetables for extra flavor without sodium.

Keep up the great work in making these positive changes to your diet!

1. Salmon (200g): Excellent! Rich in omega-3s (about 4g) for reducing inflammation. Provides about 44g of protein.

2. Sweet potato (150g): Good complex carbs, about 30g. Rich in beta-carotene for immune function.

3. Broccoli (100g): Great for fiber and micronutrients. Only 6g of carbs but packed with vitamins.

4. Olive oil drizzle: Good for healthy fats. Aim for 1 tbsp (14g) for about 120 calories.

This meal is a good start but could use some adjustments:

- Increase sweet potato to 250g for more carbs (50g total) to support your training.
- Add 1 cup of cooked quinoa (185g) for extra 220 calories and 8g of protein.
- Include 1 tbsp of chia seeds for extra 70 calories and 2g of omega-3s.

Total calories should be around 900-1000 for this meal.

Supplements to consider:
- 1000mg of Vitamin D3 daily for bone health
- 500mg of Vitamin C to support your immune system
- 5g of creatine monohydrate daily for improved performance and recovery

Remember to drink at least 500ml of water with this meal. Aim for a total daily fluid intake of 3-4 liters, increasing on heavy training days.

Keep up the great work, Jeremie!""",

1. Bowl of pasta: While pasta provides quick energy, it's not the best choice for sustained focus and good sleep. Here's how to improve it:
   - Switch to whole grain pasta for more fiber and nutrients.
   - Add grilled chicken or tofu for protein.
   - Include plenty of vegetables like spinach, broccoli, and cherry tomatoes.
   - Use olive oil and herbs instead of heavy sauces.

2. For tomorrow, I suggest:
   - Breakfast: Overnight oats with chia seeds, berries, and a scoop of protein powder. Green tea instead of coffee.
   - Morning snack: Apple slices with almond butter.
   - Lunch: Quinoa bowl with grilled chicken, mixed vegetables, and avocado. Add a small dark chocolate square for a treat.
   - Afternoon snack: Greek yogurt with walnuts and a drizzle of honey.
   - Dinner: Grilled salmon, sweet potato, and steamed broccoli. Add a small side salad with olive oil and lemon dressing.

3. General tips:
   - Stay hydrated! Aim for at least 2-3 liters of water throughout the day.
   - Take short breaks every hour to stretch and rest your eyes.
   - Consider supplements like Omega-3, Vitamin D, and Magnesium for brain function and stress reduction.
   - Limit caffeine after 2 PM to improve sleep quality.
   - Try meditation or deep breathing exercises to manage stress.

Remember, good nutrition, hydration, and regular breaks are key to maintaining high performance during your hackathon. Good luck, Julien!""",
